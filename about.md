Nick Goossens is passionate about architecting and building great software. From age 7 when
he wrote his first QBasic program he knew computers were his future. Of course tools and languages
have changed since then and he now calls Node.js and C# his languages of choice.

Nick has co-founded two start-ups, Toodu a request for service business and Connecto a personal
business directory. He has also enjoyed leading a local developer community in Cape Town, South Africa
and presenting at larger events like Microsoft Tech-Ed.

When not sitting behind a computer he loves to be in the Mountains most likely trail running,
rock climbing or hiking.
